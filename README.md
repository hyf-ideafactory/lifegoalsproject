# My Dream Life Game

A gamified goal-tracking web application (and transparently, a Christmas present for my partner) where completing goals unlocks dice rolls that lead to real-world rewards. 

## Objective
The goal of this MVP is to...
- Explore whether gamification and tangible rewards increase follow-through on personal goals
- To gain more experience with web application development 

## How it works
- The user maintains a list of goals (up to 20)
- Completing a goal triggers a dice roll (resulting in a value of 1-6)
- The dice roll moves the user across a 20-tile gameboard
- Landing on a tile reveals a reward
- Rewards and updates are sent via email to the user and the administrator of the game

## MVP Guardrails
- Single user
- No authentication
- Only one dice roll per completed goal
- Email serves as the reward contract
- Built using React + Vite
